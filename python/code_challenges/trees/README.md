## Trees
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
- A tree is a nonlinear data structure, compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data structures. A tree can be empty with no nodes or a tree is a structure consisting of one node called the root and zero or one or more subtrees.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- making tree data structure and make Tree nodes then make another class called binary search tree that inherits from the binary tree class
- binary search tree contains to methods a- add b- contains

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- Add
  - Arguments: value
  - Return: nothing
  - Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
- Contains
  - Argument: value
  - Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your trees -->
- Add time complexity: O(log n) cuz we add with binary search tree.
- Contains time complexity: O(log n) cuz we are doing a binary search tree

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

- find the max_value inside binary tree

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- max_value
  - Arguments: tree-root
  - Return: max_value
  
## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your trees -->
- max_value time complexity: O(n) cuz we max_value with binary tree and we have to visit all tree nodes
- max_value space complexity: O(1) cuz we are doing a binary tree and returning only the value

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

- Traverse tree using breadth-first traversal approach. 

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- breadth-first traversal
  - Arguments: tree
  - Return: list includes the tree value 
  
## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your trees -->
- breadth-first traversal time complexity: O(n) cuz we max_value with binary tree and we have to visit all tree nodes
- breadth-first traversal space complexity: O(n) cuz we are doing a binary tree and returning list that has all the tree nodes
