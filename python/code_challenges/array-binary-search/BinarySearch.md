# Reverse an Array
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- the problem domain is:
making afunction called BinarySearch that take asorted array and value then search for this value in the array then return the index of that value if the value not in the sorted array then return -1
note: we only have to use binary search to solve this challenge this means the list is should be orderd

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- TDD: its faster for simple problem like this
-building afunction to use binary search
- O(logn) , O(n)
