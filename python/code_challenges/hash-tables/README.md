# Hash tables
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
- The hash table is implemented in python and the collision is handled by the chaining method.
- do the implementation of the hash table in python and handle the collision case

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- do the implementation of the hash table in python and handle the collision case
- add the hash functions add, remove, contains, and get
- do the testing of the hash table

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- Test driven development (TDD)

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your hashtable -->
- add(key, value): adds a key-value pair to the hash table
- remove(key) : removes a key from the hash table
- contains(key): contains a key in the hash table
- get(key): gets the key from the hash table
- hash(key): hashes the key and return index

# code challenge31: hash table implementation hashmap-repeated-word

<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Write a function called repeated word that finds the first word to occur more than once in a string
input => string with words
output => first word to occur more than once

- example:
input: "I am a cat and I am a dog"
output: "I"

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- do the implementation of the hash table in python and handle the collision case
- find word to occur more than once in a string

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- Test driven development (TDD)

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your hashtable -->
- hashmap-repeated-word (string): returns the first word to occur more than once in a string.
