# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
- making asingly linked list with some methode (assert , include , return str)
- building small tests for the linked-list classes to make sure that we are working correctly

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- to handle the __str__ method and how to loop over each node and get the value then append it to the return string

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
-TDD => Big O(1) for the insertion and Big O(n) for the includes, I Have choise this approch becase we cam make our test then start making the code functions also allows us to take advantage of single responspilty approch so we can test our functions.

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
- insert => insert the value to the linked-list
- include => to check if the value is already in the linkedList
- some of the magic methods such as (__repr__ , __str__)
