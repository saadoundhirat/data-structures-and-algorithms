# LAB 05 (Singly Linked List)
# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
- making asingly linked list with some methode (assert , include , return str)
- building small tests for the linked-list classes to make sure that we are working correctly

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- to handle the __str__ method and how to loop over each node and get the value then append it to the return string

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
-TDD => Big O(1) for the insertion and Big O(n) for the includes, I Have choise this approch becase we cam make our test then start making the code functions also allows us to take advantage of single responspilty approch so we can test our functions.

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
- insert => insert the value to the linked-list
- include => to check if the value is already in the linkedList
- some of the magic methods such as (__repr__ , __str__)

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
-TDD => BigO(1) Spsce and BigO(n) Time  for all the functions , I Have choise this approch becase we cam make our test then start making the code functions also allows us to take advantage of single responspilty approch so we can test our functions.

# LAB 07 (test_kth_node_from_end)

[Miro_link](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_l3msfqo=/)

# Challenge Summary
<!-- 
- making a function inside class linked list name append and this functions takes a value 
- append that item to the end of the linked list
- loop to the end of the linked list using current.next thats allowed you to get the current as the last node and makes it faster )-->

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
-TDD => BigO(1) Spsce and BigO(n) Time  for all the k-th , I Have choice this approch because we cam make our test then start making the code functions also allows us to take advantage of single responsibility approch so we can test our functions.

# LAB 09 (reverse linkes list)

[Miro_link](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_l3msfqo=/)

# Challenge Summary
<!-- 
-add a function that can take a linked kist then return that linked list reversed 

- making a function inside class linked list 
- that function loop over the given linked list to reach the None and each time its insert current node to the new list
- make sure the linked list is not empty
