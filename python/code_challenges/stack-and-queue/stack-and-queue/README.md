<!-- we are implementing stack and queue here then we are writing tests to check our work-->

## Challenge
<!-- implementing stack and queue -->

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- TDD: its faster for simple problem like this
