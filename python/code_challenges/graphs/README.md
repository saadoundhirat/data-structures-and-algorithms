# Graphs Code challenge35
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
building a graph class that includes the following methods:

- add_node
- add_edge
- get_nodes
- get_edges
- get_neighbors
- breadth_first_search
- depth_first_search

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
building a graph class that includes the following methods:

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Using a dictionary to store the nodes and edges.

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in your Graph -->
- add node
  - Arguments: value
  - Returns: The added node
  - Add a node to the graph
- add edge
  - Arguments: 2 nodes to be connected by the edge, weight (optional)
  - Returns: nothing
  - Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
  - If specified, assign a weight to the edge
  - Both nodes should already be in the Graph
- get nodes
  - Arguments: none
  - Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)
- get neighbors
  - Arguments: node
  - Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node
  - Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection
- size
  - Arguments: none
  - Returns the total number of nodes in the graph

# Code challenge 36
